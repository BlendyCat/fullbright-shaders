# FullBright Shaderpack
The FullBright Shaderpack by BlendyCat is intended to help with general
visibility for the average Minecraft player. This will make mining less
tedious and resource intensive as you will only now have to use torches
as a means to keep away mobs. This will make seeing ores in the dark much
more easy.

## Installation
1) Install Optifine (Optifine.net)
2) Download the FullBright-Shaders.zip
3) Go to `%appdata%` or wherever your Minecraft directory is located
4) Move the FullBright-Shaders.zip into the shaderpack folder
5) Go back to Minecraft and click on Options... -> Video Settings... ->
Shaders... Now you should see "FullBright-Shaders" as one of the options.
6) Click on "FullBright-Shaders" and you're all set!
